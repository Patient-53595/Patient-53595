- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Patient-53595
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Games of different sorts, amateur level programming, and writing. Content can, and most likely will be, NSFW.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Practice, practice, practice.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... On Discord, @ Patient#7804. Look for the gold star. 

Otherwise, on Twitter, which I haven't used in over a year, @P53595.

If you're really desperate to get to me and neither of the previous worked, I'm probably either dead or on vacation, because I pretty much only use them.
